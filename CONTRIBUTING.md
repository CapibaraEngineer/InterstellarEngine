## Contributing a fix or a feature 
If you've created a new feature or fix follow these steps to make a pull request:

1. If you haven't already, create a fok of the repository.
2. Create a topic branch, make all fo your changes on that branch.
3. Submit a pull request.

### Good pull request
Focus on only one feature or fix, if you want to submit multiple changes submit them in different pull requests. 
And limit your changes to only what is required to implemnet the fix or feature, and avoid style or formatting tool that may change other areas of the code. And rebember to follow the coding convetions.

## Coding convetions
